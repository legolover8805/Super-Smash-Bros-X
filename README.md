# Super-Smash-Bros-X

Super Smash Bros X was a fan-game based on the Super Smash Bros series made by me, Reda Razza, when I was in high school. Off and on, I would work on this project as a hobby as it gradually came together.
The intent of the game was to add characters who would likely never officially be in the real Smash Bros Fighting Game myself and see how they would play.

The last time I ever worked on it, I was trying to add local and then online multiplayer, and I stopped working on it when it was in a broken state, so right now, the project is likely unplayable.

However, I recorded progress videos showcasing a couple of features/characters. Only two of them were ever on YouTube, so here they are:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QejUHyFuQ_s - Progress Report of the character Zero from Mega Man X in the game. I had other videos on my local drive, which I have since lost, so this is more focused on shields/whatever I was working on at that time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OaCMFITtj8 - Progress Report of the character Geno from Super Mario RPG in the game. This was the only character I ever fully finished 100%, so here is his complete moveset showcased, although it is hard to understand without commentary.

I learned a lot about programming, game design, animation, and game mechanics with this project, which has shaped every other thing I've ever worked on. If I ever decide to go back to make a game like this, I would restart this entire project (because a lot of this code is outdated and I know I can do better), likely in a different engine, and with everything I know now, likely have a better project out quicker.
